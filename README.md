This is a curated, open-source project of common Python collections with
full support for types. Initially started as a side-project to abstract
away some common patterns in other projects, this library continues to grow to
become a full standard library of efficient algorithms.

## Credits

Thanks to Wolfgang De Meuter's introductory course to algorithms and data
structures for teaching many of the concepts that are used in this library.

Many thanks to @w8r for providing a [reference implementation][w8r] of the
AVL-tree data structure.

A thank you to the authors of the book _Introduction to Algorithms_ for
coverage of most, if not all, of the algorithms that are being used here.
